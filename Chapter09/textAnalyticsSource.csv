We had a trip in beautiful weather and had a great guide.
The sights were amazing but the prices were far too high. 
Then all of a sudden the weather got bad and the mood turned bad too. 
We drove from the west of the island to the east. 
When we arrived in the east the wind and the rain stopped again and the trip was saved.
When we returned home the memories that stayed were so amazing.
